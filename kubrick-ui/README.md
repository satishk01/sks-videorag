Welcome to Kubrick UI!

This is the user interface for Kubrick. A simple chatbot interface that allows you to interact with the Kubrick Video Processing Agent.

The application should be run inside the docker compose application, but you can check that everything works by installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

and running the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```
