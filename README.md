## 📖 About This Course
Tired of tutorials that just walk you through connecting an existing MCP server to Claude Desktop? 

Yeah, us too.

That's why we built **Kubrick AI**, an MCP Multimodal Agent for video processing tasks. Yes! You read that right. 

> 💡 Agents + Video Processing ... and MCP! 

This course, is a collaboration between The Neural Maze and Neural Bits (from now on, "The Neural Bros"), and it's built for developers who want to go beyond the basics and build serious, production-ready AI Systems. In particular, you'll:

* Learn how to build an MCP server for video processing using Pixeltable and FastMCP

* Design custom agents powered by Groq or AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2), connected to your MCP server

* Integrate your agentic system with Opik for full observability and prompt versioning

* **NEW**: Multi-provider AI support with seamless switching between OpenAI, Groq, AWS Bedrock, and AWS Transcribe


## 🖊️ What you'll learn
* Learn how to use Pixeltable for multimodal data processing and stateful agents

* Create complex MCP servers using FastMCP: expose resources, prompts and tools

* Apply prompt versioning to your MCP server (instead of defining the prompts in the Agent API)

* Learn how to implement custom MCP clients for your agents

* Implement MCP Tool Agents from scratch, using Llama 4 Scout/Maverick or Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2

* Use Opik for MCP prompt versioning

* Learn how to implement custom tracing and monitoring with Opik

> 🚀 No shortcuts. No fluff. Let's learn by doing.

## 💻 What You'll Do:

Completing this course, you'll learn how to design and enable Agents to understand multimodal data, across images, video, audio and text inputs all within a single system. 

Specifically, you'll get to:

- Build a complex Multimodal Processing Pipeline
- Build a Video Search Engine and expose its functionality to an Agent via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Build a production ready API to power the Agent.
- Integrate LLMOps principles and best software engineering practices.
- Learn about video, embeddings, streaming APIs, Vision Language Models (VLMs) and more.

After completing this course, you'll have built your own Kubrick Agent with a HAL themed spin-off, to play the role of a new set of eyes and ears:

## Getting Started

Kubrick is **not** a simple tutorial. So, to get this system up and running, there are a few things you need to do first.

We have detailed the steps to get you started, in this [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) file.

> 💡 Having Kubrick running is just the first step! Now that you have it up and running, it's time to actually understand how it works (see [Course Syllabus](#-course-syllabus)).

## 🧑‍🎓 Who is this course for?
You'll get the most of this course by building it yourself, from the ground up. 
The course components are structured to cover key concepts, and showcase how to build on top of them, towards AI Systems.

| Target Audience |	Skills you'll get |
| ----- | ------------------|
| ML/AI Engineers |	Build complex MCP Servers, learn to apply AI Models to Video, Images and Speech.|
| Software Engineers | Learn to connect AI Components with APIs, building end-to-end agentic applications.|
| Data Engineers/Scientists | Learn to design an AI System, managing Video/Audio/Image data processing and structure.

Regardless of your experience or title, this course aims to unpack complex topics in practical terms and concepts you could understand, learn and apply - helping you to build a complete AI system.

## 🎓 Prerequisites
In this section, we outlined a few requirements and nice-to-haves to improve your learning experience while taking this course.
| Category | Label | Description |
|----------| ----- | ----------- |
| Programming Skills (Beginner) | Requirement | Understanding of Programming in general, and the Python language syntax.
| AI/ML Concepts (Beginner) | Nice to Have | Understanding the basic concepts behind AI, AI Models and AI Systems.
| LLMs, MCP, Agents | Nice to Have | Perfect if you know about them, not a problem if you don't. We'll teach and explain it step by step.
| Laptop/PC with any OS | Requirement | AI Models inference requires compute. To overcome that, we'll mainly use API based models.|

The overall level of this course is Beginner/Intermediate, but don't worry. We'll aim to explain every component step by step designed for a larger audience.

## 💰 What's the cost?
This course and its materials are open-source and completely free, thanks to our sponsors, Pixeltable and Opik!
